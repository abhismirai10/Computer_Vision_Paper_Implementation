# Computer Vision Paper Implementations

This repository contains implementations of various papers in the field of computer vision for practice and learning purposes. The goal is to build and understand different neural network architectures by implementing them on various datasets.

## Implementations

### 1. Basic Fully Connected Neural Network
- **File:** `x1_FC_Digit_Classification_mnist.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook contains the implementation of a basic fully connected neural network for digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

### 2. Deeper Fully Connected Neural Network
- **File:** `x2_Deeper_FC_Digit_Cassification_mnist.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook includes a deeper fully connected neural network for improved digit classification performance on the MNIST dataset.

### 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **File:** `x3_CNN_Digit_Classification_mnist.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook provides the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for digit classification on the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with these implementations, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhismirai10/Computer_Vision_Paper_Implementation
    cd Computer_Vision_Paper_Implementation
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Open the notebooks:**
    You can open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. **Run the notebooks:**
    Select and run the cells in each notebook to see the implementations in action.

## Future Implementations

I plan to implement more computer vision papers regularly and update this repository with new notebooks. Stay tuned for more implementations!
